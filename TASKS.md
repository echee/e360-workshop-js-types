# Types of types!

## Fundamentals

- What's a type?
    - shapes and jigsaw puzzles
    - logic, and the quest for being 'well formed'
    - types are like lightweight proof systems
    - types help us catch bugs
    - types help us reason about programs
    - types give us documentation
- typed vs. untyped langs
    - assembly vs. JS
- opt-in, 'gradual' typing system
- a 'structural' type system vs. a 'nominal' type system
- types in JS
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Number
    - String
    - Symbol
    - Object
- Static vs. dynamic
    - Proptypes vs. static analysis
    - failing at runtime vs. failing at compile time
- flow vs. typescript
- modeling your domain with types
- type driven dev
- naming conventions
    - PascalCase
    - Doesn't need 'type' or 'ty' in it (unless you are writing your own language)

- type coercions

-types in flow/typescript
    - any, the untyped type
    - falling back to any
    - bad imports
    - `--strict` flag on `tsc`
    - using types with relay / graphql
        - importing generated types
        - hooking them up

## Our Project

- Add flow types to project
- Install TypeScript and port the types over

## For next time

- Algebraic Data Types
